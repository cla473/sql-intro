Three common options for storage are
text files,
spreadsheets,
and databases.
Text files are easiest to create,
and work well with version control,
but then we would have to build search and analysis tools ourselves.
Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analyses,
but they don't handle large or complex data sets well.
Databases, however, include powerful tools for search and analysis,
and can handle large, complex data sets.
These lessons will show how to use a relational database to explore data,
using SQL - Structured Query Language.
